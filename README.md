# Water Potability Prediction (ML Project)

This project predicts whether water is **safe for drinking (potable)** or not, based on chemical and physical properties of water.

##  Dataset
The dataset includes measurements such as:
- pH
- Hardness
- Solids
- Chloramines
- Sulfate
- Conductivity
- Organic Carbon
- Trihalomethanes
- Turbidity
- Potability (target variable)

##  Installation
Clone this repository and install the required libraries:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HIIISHAM911/water-potability-ml.git
cd water-potability-ml
pip install -r requirements.txt
